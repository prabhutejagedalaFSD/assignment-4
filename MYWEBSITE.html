        <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
    <p>My name is <em>gedala prabhuteja</em>, and I completed my B.Tech in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Vikas College of
        Engineering and Technology in 2016. Although my academic background is in core engineering, my interest in
        technology and software development has led me to transition into the world of web development. I am constantly working on improving my skills, exploring new technologies, and staying updated with current trends in web development.</p>

        <h2>PROJECT:</h2>
        <P>In my academic year I am presented a main project with my team as I am team leader and reporting a project on <strong>      "COMPARISON OF DIFFERENT CONTROL STRATEGIES OF STATCOM FOR POWER QUALITY IMPROVEMENT OF GRID CONNECTED WIND ENERGY SYSTEM"</strong> and getting a outstanding performance.</P><br>
        <h3>abstract:</h3>
        <p>	With the increase in demand for Electricity due to the increase in population and industrialization, the generation of power is really a challenge nowadays. It is necessary to meet the energy needs by utilizing the renewable energy resources like wind, biomass, hydro co-generation, etc. Injection of the wind power into an electric grid affects the power quality. The main power quality issues are voltage sag, swell, flickers, harmonics etc.</p><br>
        <p> In this proposed scheme Static Compensator (STATCOM) is connected at the point of common coupling with a battery energy storage system (BESS) to mitigate the power quality issues. The battery energy storage is integrated to sustain the real power source under fluctuating wind power. Here two control schemes for STATCOM are compared: Bang-Bang current controller and Fuzzy logic controller. Bang-Bang controller is a hysteresis current controlled technique. The operation of the two STATCOM control schemes for maintaining the power quality of the grid connected wind energy system is investigated using MATLAB/SIMULINK.</p>
